# Human-Predictor
* The idea is to get it to function optimally on an embedded system eventually. Upon completion, it should be able to identify:
	* Race
	* Sex
	* Age Bracket
	* Face Location

The project is ongoing. Curated a dataset of 30000 images for this project. The next steps include:
	* Creating a neural network that performs all the tasks listed above in as little time as possible without compromising efficiency. Also, minimizing the weight footprint is crucial.
	* Current neural nets for reference are Squeezenet, Mobilenet V2 etc.
